## Why am I creating a website?
During the semester (around finals season) I was of course studying vigorously, but at the same time the job application frenzy did not cease. Many applications had the option of providing the recruitment team with a personal portfolio page, which is what initially prompted the development of this website. 

## Why a website?
Long story short, I suck at webdev so for the most part I dreaded doing this. In high school, my introduction to coding was web development. I didn't really understand how to approach the learning curve, so that led to a distaste for the overall realm of software development. Back to the original story - so why exactly am I doing this now? The answer is simple - I find value in detaching myself from the hustle and bustle of undergraduate studies and reflect on my journey, whether it be academic or spiritual. I've always wanted an outlet to share some of my thoughts, and what better way to do that than leave another digital footprint. On a more serious note there's definitely something very therapeutic about spilling your most intrusive thoughts with a good ol' pen and notebook, but I conveniently chose to launch a website because I thought it would be cool to reflect on my life with more imagery (pictures!) and creative elements. 

## A little about me
### Education
Currently I am a junior studying Electrical Engineering at Rice University doing medical imaging research with overarching interests in FPGAs, data science, and medical device instrumentation. 

I graduated from Chadwick School in Palos Verdes Peninsuala with honors (Cum Laude) and was Math Team, Science Olympiad Team, and Coding Club captains. I also conducted select pieces for the Chadwick Orchestra, and played Alto Saxophone for the Palos Verdes Symphonic Band and the Asia America Youth Symphony. In a past life I (very poorly) played piano. 

### Athletics
I love sports too. In high school I played competitive badminton (ranked top 30 in the US for Under 17 boy's singles), and I'm currently enjoying running and biking very much. 

### Travel
If I had a disposable income I would travel every month. Nothing beats the exhilaration of enjoying cuisines, admiring artwork, and immersing myself in cultures that continue to shape my worldview. My top destinations would have to be Japan, Switzerland, Italy, and Singapore. 

## Current state
As I'm sitting in Basis Point Ginza (picture of my setup above), an overwhelming sense of my-Japan-trip-is-gonna-end-soon depression is settling in.
